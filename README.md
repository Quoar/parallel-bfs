*****************

MON, Nov 09, 2015
Implemented sequential form of breath first search.
Algorith using 1D partitioning in progress and sequential form will help in comparing results.
And to gain insight in computation speedup achieved by parallelism. Initially generated data
for 60,000 graph vertices.

added sequential_bfs.c
added GraphInput.odt
